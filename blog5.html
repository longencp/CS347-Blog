        This week we began our study of JavaScript. It has been really interesting learning how to use JavaScript and how
        to integrate it into a website. Alongside learning about JavaScript, we also finished our static site project. Part
        of this project was completeting peer reviews, and as I was reviewing people, I noticed it was common to include 
        contact information. This made me curious about how to best include contact information in a website.

       In my research, I came across <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/mobile/25-web-development-tips-boost-your-skills-
       10126001">this article</a>. One of the sections of the article explains how to use "tel" in an href tag to indicate
       a phone number. This allows mobile devices to call the number directly from the website, giving the user a much
       easier experience than if they had to copy it into their phone app. For example, clicking this number:
       <a href="tel: 9512623062">951-262-3062</a> on a mobile phone, you can call Santa! below is the code I used:
    <pre>
        &lta href="tel: 9512623062"&gt951-262-3062&lt/a&gt
    </pre>
