    <h1>Blog Post #1</h1>
    <p> This week I started learning about HTML and how to use it. I learned many different element tags used to format
        the webpage such as divs, headers, paragraphs, and more. As I was doing the reading for this week, I came across
        the section about screen readers and I became very interested in how specifically to optomize a webpage for a
        screen reader.</p>
    <p> I did some research and ended up finding an <a href=https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader>article from
            WebAIM</a> about making webpages more accessible for screen readers which ended up being very helpful. One
        helpful thing that I learned was that using heading and paragraph tags
        are important ways to organize main ideas of the page, as users can jump between these. Another aspect of html
        which is particularly helpful for people using screen readers in the lang attribute for the span tag. This can
        be used to specify the language that is being read, so that if the webpage inclues sections in other languages,
        the reader knows how to pronounce them. For example, if I wanted to say <q>If I wanted to say hello in Spanish,
            I would say hola</q> and I wanted to make sure that the <q>hola</q> was pronounced correctly, then I could
        specify it like in the code below:
    <pre>
        &lt;p&gt;If I wanted to say hello in Spanish, I would say &lt;span lang="es"&gt;hola&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
    </p>
