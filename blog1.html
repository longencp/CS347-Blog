    <h1>Blog Post #1</h1>
    <p> This week I started learning about HTML and how to use it. I learned many different element tags used to format
        the webpage such as divs, headers, paragraphs, and more. As I was doing the reading for this week, I came across
        the section about screen readers and I became very interested in how specifically to optomize a webpage for a
        screen reader.</p>
