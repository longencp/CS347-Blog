    <h1>Blog Post #2: 9/9/21</h1>
    <div></div>
    <p>This week we started learning about CSS which I found really interesting. This included learning how to change
        background colors, font colors, font styles, and sizes of different elements.
        It was a lot of fun being able to have more control over the style of my wepages
        than I had without using CSS last week. I became interested in what more I could do with CSS aside from what
        was in the readings for this week so I decided to look into some fun things to use CSS for.
    </p>
    <p>In my research, I found a few different CSS properties that I found interesting, but my favorite
        was shape-outside. This is what is causing the oval shape beside the text, pushing the text towards the left.
        This allows text to wrap around an element (in this case an ellipse) which can be a pre defined shape, such as a
        circle or
        polygon, or even an image. Using CSS, the developer can control many factors such as the color and opacity.
        Additionally, using clip-path, the developer can change the specific dimentions of the shape, without changing
        its imapct on the text around it. For example, the following code created the oval which is pushing this text
        back:</p>
    <pre>div {
        shape-outside: ellipse(100px 200px at 50% 50%);
        clip-path: ellipse(100px 200px at 50% 50%);
        width: 200px;
        height: 500px;
        float: left;
        opacity: .2;
        background-color: lightblue;
      }   
    </pre>
