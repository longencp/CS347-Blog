    <h1>Blog Post #4: 9/23/21</h1>
    <p> 
        This week we continuted our learning about CSS and talked about accessibility. I thought it was really
        interesting how the textbook talked about why it is important to make sure websites are accessible on 
        both mobile and desktop screen sizes. This made me a lttle more aware of my designs and gave me a greater
        desire to ensure my webpages are accessible to everyone.

        While doing some research of my own I came across 
        <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2016/10/20-essential-css-tricks-every-designer-should-know/">
        an article</a> which showed me some new tricks with CSS. The part I thought was most cool was the section
        about link states. The link and visited classes control what happens to links before and after a user has 
        used them. For example, if you wanted to make sure that a visited link was super obvious the visited class 
        could be used to change the color and other attributes of the link. Try it on <a href="linkDemo.html">
        this link</a> (the code I used for this is below)!
    <pre>
        a:link {
            color:lightblue;
        }
        a:visited {
            color: orange;
        }
    </pre>
