    <h1>Blog Post #9: 11/19/21</h1>
    <p>
        This week we continued our study of react and JSX. It has been really interesting learning more
        about how to use react and how it is different from the topics we covered at the beginning of the semester.
        I became more curious about how react changes things that are also in HTML and began to research it.

    <p>
        In my research, I came across <a href="https://dev.to/tumee/react-fragments-what-why-how-2kh1">
        an article</a> which explained fragments vs divs. Divs are not always useful and can require unnecessary 
        syntax. As a solution, react has something called fragments. Fragments can replace wrapper divs and can hold a list
        of html elements. For example this code from the article using divs: 
        <pre>
        &lttable&gt
            &lttr&gt
              &ltdiv&gt
                &lttd&gtHello&lt/td&gt
                &lttd&gtWorld&lt/td&gt
              &lt/div&gt
            &lt/tr&gt
          &lt/table&gt
        </pre>
          could be re-written using this
          <pre>
            &ltReact.Fragment&gt
                &lttd>Hello&lt/td&gt
                &lttd>World&lt/td&gt
              &lt/React.Fragment&gt
          </pre>
    </p>
