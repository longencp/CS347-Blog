    <p>
        If I were teaching CS 347 next fall, I wouldn't change too much of the course structure, but I would
        change some. First, I think that I would spend less time on the HTML and CSS concepts. These were
        fairly simple topics, and were able to be explained quickly. With the extra time, I would focus more
        on JavaScript and React concepts. These were a lot harder to understand, and there were a lot of concepts
        that were hard to get from the reading and apply to other problems. Additionally, I would include some 
        lectures to help solidify some of the understanding first gained from the readings.
    </p>

        With that being said, there are some parts about this course that I would not change. One of these 
        is labs. Labs were a great way for me to apply some of the concepts I learned about in the reading,
        and they usually went very well with the reading for that day. I also think the PAs were structured 
        very well and I would want to replicate that.
