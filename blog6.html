    <h1>Blog Post #6: 10/15/21</h1>
    <p>
        This week we began our study of JavaScript. We learned more about server-side scripting which has been really
        interesting. Additionally, we are starting to think about our next project, which made me reflect on what I wish
        I
        could have improved in my first one. One of the things I didn't love about my website was the forms and how I
        did not
        know how to style them well, so I became curious how I could do that.
    </p>

        In my research, I came across <a
            href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-style-forms-with-css-a-beginners-guide/">this article</a>.
        I discovered that input types have several properties that a developer can customize with CSS. These include
        padding
        to make sure the text is not right alongside the border, border-radius to determine how rounded the border
        should be,
        box_shadow to give a shadow effect, and font-family and font-size to change the font of the text inside the box.
        For example:
        <input type="text" placeholder="formatted text input">
        below is the code I used:
    <pre>
    CSS:
       input {
        padding: 10px;
        margin: 10px;
        border-radius: 20px;
        box-shadow: 0 0 15px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.603);
        font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
        font-size: 15px;
    } 
    HTML:
        &ltinput type="text" placeholder="formatted text input"&gt

    </pre>
