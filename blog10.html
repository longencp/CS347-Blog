    <h1>Blog Post #10: 12/2/21</h1>
    <p>
        This week we continued our study of react and JSX. Learning this has been very difficult for me, especially
        when it comes to errors. React tends to crash whenever there is an error, and I was wondering how to relieve this.
        When thinking about blog post ideas this week I was keeping this in the back of my mind.

        In my research, I came across <a href="https://morioh.com/p/5a2ce9ee174d">
        an article</a> which explained Error Boundaries. These are components which catch errors. This prevents the whole
        application from breaking and allows you to catch the error and respond accordingly with the ComponentDidCatch()
        component. Below is a code example from the article in which the code catches an error with the state and displays the error.
