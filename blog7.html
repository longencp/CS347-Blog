    <h1>Blog Post #7: 11/5/21</h1>
    <p>
        This week we began our study of React. This is a very new concept to me and I have found it interesting to learn about.
        With that being said, I honestly don't understand it super well yet, but I have been really curious to learn more about it. Something I have been 
        curious for a while is how to use form data in react, so I decided to do some research on it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In doing my research, I found an article on React's website titled <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html">forms</a>
        which explains how react can utilize form data on a specific event. You are able to use state.value to hold the value given in the form. When creating
        the form you use 
        <pre>&ltinput type="text" value={this.state.value}&gt</pre>. Setting the value to this.state.value allows it to be used in other parts of the program. One example
        from the article uses this to create a pop up which alerts the user each time someone enters a name and presses the submit button. I think knowing this will make
        forms more useful and I found it really interesting to learn about.
