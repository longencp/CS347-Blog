    <h1>Blog Post #8: 11/11/21</h1>
    <p>
        This week we continued our study of JavaScript in React. I have been trying to further my understnading of the fundamentials, and I realized that in doing that
        I did not know much about how to style a page using React. Because of this I decided to look further into how to use CSS in React for my research.
    </p>
    <p>
        In doing my research, I found an article on React's website titled <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_css.asp">Style React Using CSS</a>
        which explains how react can create JavaScript objects which can hold style information. This can be used to apply specific styling information to elements.
        The code below is from the article and I think does a good job demonstrating how this would be used. 
        <pre>class MyHeader extends React.Component {
            render() {
              const mystyle = {
                color: "white",
                backgroundColor: "DodgerBlue",
                padding: "10px",
                fontFamily: "Arial"
              };
              return (
                &ltdiv&gt
                &lth1 style={mystyle}&gtHello Style!&lt/h1&gt
                &ltp&gtAdd a little style!&lt/p&gt
                &lt/div&gt
              );
            }
          }</pre>
    </p>
